       1	Description
       2	The function of this applet is very simple, create a menu based on the files/folders found inside a main folder (specified on this applet settings window). The files will be used to create menu items and the sub folders will be used to create sub-menus.
       3	I mainly created this applet to replicate the functionality of the XFCE plugin called **Directory Menu** and the KDE widget called **Quick access**.
       4	Warning
       5	This applet has to read every single file/folder inside a main folder to create its menu. So, do not try to use this applet to create a menu based on a folder that contains thousands of files!!! Your system may slow down, freeze or even crash!!!
       6	Features
       7	More than one instance of this applet can be installed at the same time.
       8	A hotkey can be assigned to open/close the menu.
       9	This applet can create menu and sub-menu items even from symbolic links found inside the main folder.
      10	Settings window
      11	Image featuring different icons for each sub-menu and different icon sizes
      12	Do not install on any other version of Cinnamon.
      13	Compatibility
