       1	Description
       2	This applet is based on [Smart Panel](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/32) extension and [Show Desktop ++](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/165) applet, both authored by  **mohammad-sn**. I *mixed* both of them into an applet because there is not always room on the panel to perform the actions added by **Smart Panel**. The **Smart Panel** extension can still be installed and activated at the same time than this applet to have even more desktop actions.
       3	Features
       4	The applet icon, background color and width can be customized.
       5	Scroll over applet actions:
       6	Posibility to perform different actions for scrolling up and down.
       7	Posibility to perform different actions on left and middle click.
       8	Actions for up/down scroll and/or left/middle clicks.
       9	Show Desktop
      10	Posibility to create a windows list menu.
      11	Left/Middle/Right click on applet can be configured to open the windows list menu.
