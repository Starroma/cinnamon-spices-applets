       1	Description
       2	This applet is based on [Smart Panel](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/32) extension and [Show Desktop ++](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/165) applet, both authored by  **mohammad-sn**. I *mixed* both of them into an applet because there is not always room on the panel to perform the actions added by **Smart Panel**. The **Smart Panel** extension can still be installed and activated at the same time than this applet to have even more desktop actions.
       3	Features
       4	The applet icon, background color and width can be customized.
       5	Scroll over applet actions:
       6	Posibility to perform different actions for scrolling up and down.
       7	Posibility to perform different actions on left and middle click.
       8	Actions for up/down scroll and/or left/middle clicks.
       9	Show Desktop
      10	Posibility to create a windows list menu.
      11	Left/Middle/Right click on applet can be configured to open the windows list menu.
      12	Desktop peek functionality with configurable levels of opacity.
      13	Do not install on any other version of Cinnamon.
      14	Compatibility
